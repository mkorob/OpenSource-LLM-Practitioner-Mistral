Only label the frames if they are distinctly present.
According to Robert Entmanï¿½s definition where framing suggests that frames select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text,
in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described.
The Problem Frame articulates the issue/topic as a PROBLEM if it directly emphasizes negative effects of it.
The Solution Frame articulates the issue/topic as a SOLUTION if it directly emphasizes positive effects of it.
Assess if specific language choices, focus points, or implied assumptions in the sentence promote a distinct perspective or argument indicative of those two frames.
I will ask you to classify a text as describing such topic as a problem, as a solution, both, or neither:
Now, is the following text describing the topic/issue as a PROBLEM, as a SOLUTION, BOTH, or  NEITHER?

Only label the frames if they are distinctly present.
According to Robert Entman’s definition, framing involves selecting certain aspects of a perceived reality and making them more prominent in a communicating text. This selection process shapes how an issue is understood and guides the audience's interpretation by promoting a specific problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.

Problem Frame: A Problem Frame emphasizes adverse outcomes, risks, or threats associated with the topic.

Solution Frame: A Solution Frame emphasizes beneficial outcomes, improvements, opportunities, or resolutions associated with the topic.

Assess if specific language choices, focus points, or implied assumptions in the sentence promote a distinct perspective or argument indicative of those two frames. Consider whether the text primarily highlights problems or solutions,  blends both aspects or neither.
