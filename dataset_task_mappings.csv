Question: TORONTO - Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Monday said the United States had blocked the delivery of nearly three million face masks at the American border over the weekend. Ford said restrictions on shipments at the U.S. border have left the province with just one more week's worth of personal protective equipment for health-care workers fighting the coronavirus outbreak in Ontario. In a statement today, he says Ontario is ramping up its own production of personal protective equipment, but most of those supplies are weeks away from being in the hands of front-line health workers. At least 451 health-care workers in Ontario have tested positive for COVID-19, representing about 10 per cent of all cases in the province. In all, Ontario reported 309 new COVID-19 cases today, including 13 new deaths. There have now been a total of 4,347 cases in the province, including 1,624 patients who have recovered and 132 deaths. Allies of the United States are complaining about its ""Wild West"" tactics in outbidding or blocking shipments to buyers who have already signed deals for medical equipment.

Question: Bhubaneswar, Oct. 29 -- New Delhi: The Supreme Court has severely criticised the growing trend of police in different States summoning individuals from far corners of the country over social media postings. Hearing a petition concerning a Delhi resident Roshni Biswas who was reportedly summoned by Bengal Police for posting objectionable content on Facebook, the Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee noted that police's power to issue summons under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) cannot be used to intimidate, threaten and harass. As per reports, the apex court's comment was prompted by Bengal Police issuing summons to the 29-year-old woman who, in a Facebook post, had criticised the Mamata government for non-enforcement of lockdown norms. The FIR which relies on FB links contains a statement that the posts implied the State administration was going soft on the violation of the lockdown at Rajabazar as the area is predominantly inhabited by a particular community and that the administration is complacent while dealing with lockdown violations caused by a certain segment of the community.

Question: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced this week that he would fine social media companies that ban political candidates. Every outlet from Fox News to MSNBC fired off missives about the bill. What got lost in the news coverage is that Silicon Valley deplatforms very few politicians, save shock-jocks like Donald Trump and Laura Loomer (if you want to call her a politician). The same cannot be said for sex workers. This month, Centro University released a study estimating that 46 percent of adult influencers reported losing access to Twitter or Instagram in the last year. The bans put a permanent dent in the stars‚Äô income, with Centro estimating sex workers lose $260 million a year due to social media bans.

Question: TALLAHASSEE ‚Äì Gov. Ron DeSantis' call for punishing social media sites that deplatformed former President Donald Trump narrowly cleared a Senate committee Monday and soon will be ready for a full vote in the Legislature. Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, was the lone Republican who argued against the proposal by fellow Republican Sen. Ray Rodrigues of Naples. Brandes labeled it a ""big government bill."" ""This Senate is currently filled with small government Republicans who do believe that government shouldn't be in the lives of businesses,"" Brandes said. He added: ""This is the exact opposite of the things that we stand for."" But Rodrigues argued back that the measure doesn't defy free market principles. The bill (SB 7072) orders social media companies to publish standards with detailed definitions of when someone would be censored or blocked, and makes companies subject to as much as $100,000 fines for deplatforming a Florida candidate. ""I'm bringing you good policy supported by your constituents,"" Rodrigues said. The measure was approved 10-9 by the Appropriations Committee, its last stop before going to the Senate floor. A similar measure is ready for a full House vote. State and federal courts have generally taken a hands-off view involving regulating online platforms. Congress also has not

Question: Some of the toughest ads against Donald Trump are driven by lifelong Republicans unable to stomach the direction their party has taken. Washington: Rick Wilson apologises for running late for our phone interview: it's been a frantic morning for the veteran Republican ad-maker and his colleagues at the Lincoln Project. The anti-Trump group has just released its latest advertisement, slamming the US President for suggesting that the November 3 election may need to be delayed. In the half hour since the ad ??? titled We Will Vote ??? went live, it has already racked up more than 250,000 views online. That's nothing unusual for the operatives at the Lincoln Project, who have been pumping out attack ads at a prolific rate over recent months. ""We push really fast all the time,"" Wilson says. ""We drive ourselves and our team very hard because we think we are pursuing a worthwhile endeavour and we know it works."" The group's co-founders include Steve Schmidt, who ran Republican nominee John McCain's 2008 campaign, and conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway.

This portrays content moderation as a measure to protect public safety and prevent the spread of extremist content.

Question: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced this week that he would fine social media companies that ban political candidates. Every outlet from Fox News to MSNBC fired off missives about the bill. What got lost in the news coverage is that Silicon Valley deplatforms very few politicians, save shock-jocks like Donald Trump and Laura Loomer (if you want to call her a politician). The same cannot be said for sex workers. This month, Centro University released a study estimating that 46 percent of adult influencers reported losing access to Twitter or Instagram in the last year. The bans put a permanent dent in the stars‚Äô income, with Centro estimating sex workers lose $260 million a year due to social media bans. You won‚Äôt hear DeSantis, Fox News, Glenn Greenwald, or any other so-called free speech warriors decrying porn stars‚Äô lost incomes, so let me break down how social media companies are screwing over porn stars (and not screwing them in a good way!). Silicon Valley titans have revoked my social media access multiple times. Take my recent Snapchat ban. The Santa Monica-based app barred me from posting on my public account, so I lost the means to communicate with fans who would

Question: TALLAHASSEE ‚Äì Gov. Ron DeSantis' call for punishing social media sites that deplatformed former President Donald Trump narrowly cleared a Senate committee Monday and soon will be ready for a full vote in the Legislature. Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, was the lone Republican who argued against the proposal by fellow Republican Sen. Ray Rodrigues of Naples. Brandes labeled it a ""big government bill."" ""This Senate is currently filled with small government Republicans who do believe that government shouldn't be in the lives of businesses,"" Brandes said. He added: ""This is the exact opposite of the things that we stand for."" But Rodrigues argued back that the measure doesn't defy free market principles. The bill (SB 7072) orders social media companies to publish standards with detailed definitions of when someone would be censored or blocked, and makes companies subject to as much as $100,000 fines for deplatforming a Florida candidate. ""I'm bringing you good policy supported by your constituents,"" Rodrigues said. The measure was approved 10-9 by the Appropriations Committee, its last stop before going to the Senate floor. A similar measure is ready for a full House vote. State and federal courts have generally taken a hands-off view involving regulating online platforms. Congress also has not

The anti-Trump group has just released its latest advertisement, slamming the US President for suggesting that the November 3 election may need to be delayed. In the half hour since the ad ??? titled We Will Vote ??? went live, it has already racked up more than 250,000 views online. That's nothing unusual for the operatives at the Lincoln Project, who have been pumping out attack ads at a prolific rate over recent months. ""We push really fast all the time,"" Wilson says. ""We drive ourselves and our team very hard because we think we are pursuing a worthwhile endeavour and we know it works."" The group's co-founders include Steve Schmidt, who ran Republican nominee John McCain's 2008 campaign, and conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. Having spent most of their adult lives working to get Republicans elected, they are now producing some of the toughest anti-Trump ads on
