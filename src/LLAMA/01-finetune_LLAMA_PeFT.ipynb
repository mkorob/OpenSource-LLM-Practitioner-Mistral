    "In the next code block, you are required to set up various configuration variables that will dictate how the inference processes are executed. These variables are crucial as they define the nature of the task, the data, and the specific behaviors during the model's training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task (`task`)**: Specify the type of task you want to run inference on. The task is represented by an integer, with each number corresponding to a different type of task (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). You must select from the predefined choices, which are typically mapped to specific NLP tasks or scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset (`dataset`)**: Choose the dataset on which you want to run inference. Like tasks, datasets are identified by integers, and each number corresponds to a different dataset. Ensure that the dataset selected is relevant to the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Directory (`output_dir`)**: Define the path to the directory where you want to store the generated samples. This is where the output of your training and inference processes will be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Directory (`model_dir`)**: Define the path to the directory where you want to store the generated models. This should have sufficient memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Llama-2 Prompt** (`use_llama2_prompt`)**: Keep True if running LLAMA-2 models (provides correct prompts with system and user message separated). Set False if running OASST models.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Division Line for User Message** (`system_user_prompt_division_line`)**: Length in number of lines of the user message. Relevant only for LLAMA-2 models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Random Seed (`seed`)**: Setting a random seed ensures that the results are reproducible. By using the same seed, you can achieve the same outcomes on repeated runs under identical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Directory (`data_dir`)**: Specify the path to the directory containing the datasets you plan to use for training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Label Usage (`not_use_full_labels`)**: This boolean variable determines whether to use the full label descriptions or abbreviated labels during training and inference. Setting it to `False` means full labels will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Dataset-Task Mappings File Path (`dataset_task_mappings_fp`)**: Define the path to the file containing mappings between datasets and tasks. This file is crucial for ensuring the correct dataset is used for the specified task.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Maximum prompt length (`max_prompt_len`)**: The maximum length of prompt in tokens to be taken as input before truncating the input. Longer input sequences require more computational power to run, so the shortest sequence required to capture the text is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Number of Epochs (`n_epochs`)**: Specify the number of epochs for training the model. An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Batch size (`batch-size`)**: Number of observations used in each training and validation batch. Larger batch size requires more computational memory as one batch needs to fit on one machine, but makes learning more stable. We found that for FLAN-XL, batch size of 8 was possible by taking batch size of 4 and accumulating results of 2 batches (see  (`gradient_accumulation_steps`) below)\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Gradient accumulation steps (`gradient_accumulation_steps`)**: In a case where gradient accumulation steps is larger than 1, instead of updating the gradient after each batch, the gradient is updated after the sum of _n_ batches. This allows to train a model to learn on a larger global batch (_batch size_ * _gradient accumulation steps_) than the one that is able to fit on one machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Run_name (`run_name`)**: Optional run_name to store in WandB. We recommend to keep it null, which generates an automatic run name based on all the relevant parameters of finetuning for easier tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Maximum output length (`max_new_tokens`)**: Maximum length of prediction produced by LLAMA. For data labelling, it does not make sense to make it longer than that. \n",
    "\n",
    "17. **LoRA hyperparameters:** The values provided below were taken from Stanford Alpaca LoRA repository: https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/blob/main/finetune.py.\n"
